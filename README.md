# GDP-Analysis-of-Nepal

Background:
Nepal is a small South Asian Country with 140,800 sq km of land area located between China and India. It is also one of the poorest countries in the world with more than half of the population living below poverty line.

Summary:
The condition of Nepal has been recently improving gradually and one of the reasons for this is the expenditure of the government in the Education sector. Nepal spents a considerable proportion of its GDP on education as compared to its neighbors and this has had a positive impact on the society.
Education has played a vital role in bringing gender equality. As people become more educated and aware, they tend to leave behind the gender bias. This can be seen in the ratio of Boys to Girls enrollments in Schools which was about 0.7 in the year 2000 which has gone up to 1.0 in 2019.
The same can also be seen with the percentage of female parliment seats which has risen to be one of the highest among its neighbors at 32.7% in Nepal in the year 2019.
The impact can also be been in the vulnerability employment percentage gradually decreasing as the literacy rates goes up. The quality of life and the life expectancy improves as a result of people having access to better facilities.
